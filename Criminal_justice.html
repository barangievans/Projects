<h1>The Criminal Justice System</h1>
    <h2><span>Ethics</span> in the Criminal Justice System</h2>
<p>The criminal justice system is the network of government and private agencies intended to manage accused and convicted criminals. The criminal justice system entails multiple interrelated pillars, consisting of academia, law enforcement, forensic services, the judiciary, and corrections. These pillars are fashioned to support the ideals of legal justice. Legal justice is the result of forging the rights of individuals with the government’s corresponding duty to ensure and protect those rights – referred to as due process. These constitutional entitlements cannot be given and protected without the abiding commitments of those professionals working in the criminal justice system. Consequently, such professionals must submit themselves to the ethical principles of the criminal justice system and evidence persistent integrity in their character. This is accomplished with the help of a worthy code of professional ethics that signals competence, reliability, accountability, and overall trustworthiness – when properly administered.</p>

    <h2>Components of the Criminal Justice System</h2>
    Law enforcement is the first pillar of the criminal justice system, because it is the system that individuals first encounter when they go against the law. It is also the most visible system to society, because we see law enforcement officers every day.

    Law enforcement is made up of police officers, sheriffs, deputies, criminal investigators, detectives, and government agents who work to enforce legal policies and protect our communities. These officers investigate crimes, gather evidence, and take reports on criminal activity. Law enforcement officers may also detain offenders, give testimony in court, and continue investigating cases after making an arrest.

    Law enforcement officers are critical to keeping the public safe. Their primary goal is to maintain order in their communities, ensure citizens are protected, and arrest any individuals who break the law. When an individual is arrested, that person will then enter the court system.

    Courts

    courts in the criminal justice system

    The court system determines whether suspects are innocent or guilty for a given crime, and delivers justice to the person based on that ruling. There are both local and federal courts within this system. Local state courts handle matters like traffic violations, family disputes, and local criminal cases, while federal courts may handle larger cases that involve multiple regions or waterways.

    All courts are overseen by judges, whose main role is to ensure the rule of law is followed and to adjudicate what happens to each offender in question. Along with a team of juries, judges hear evidence presented by attorneys who argue for the guilt or innocence of the accused. There are both defense attorneys and prosecution lawyers, who fight for or against the suspected criminal. Judges also oversee trials, accept or reject plea agreements, and determine the severity of sentences for those convicted of a crime. Suspects who are determined guilty in court enter the corrections system after sentencing.

    Corrections

    The third component of the criminal justice system is corrections, which handles the sentencing and punishment of offenders, as adjudicated in court. After offenders are convicted in the courts, the corrections system will separate them from the rest of society. Offenders may be incarcerated in prison or put on probation/parole, where they will be monitored closely by dedicated officers.

    Corrections officers supervise convicted offenders who are serving sentences in prison. Probation officers are responsible for offenders who need to be monitored by court, in lieu of serving jail time. Parole officers supervise offenders who are released from prison early, ensuring they adhere to their parole terms (such as regular drug testing, staying in one location, and avoiding criminal behavior).

    Corrections officers also play a key role in rehabilitating criminal offenders. Their main goal is to provide a system where those accused of a crime are monitored, reformed, and released if and when ready, to hopefully not commit a crime again. These professionals make sure that correctional facilities are safe and secure, and oversee the day-to-day routines of inmates. Probation and parole officers play an important role in helping people re-adjust to mainstream life, and enter society at a functional level after (or instead of) serving time.
